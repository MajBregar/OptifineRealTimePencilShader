# OptifineRealTimePencilShader
Real Time Pencil Shader for the OptiFine Minecraft modification

## TODO

### LATER
- make/find paper normal map

### REALLY LOW PRIO
- make transparent blocks texture correctly
- make intuitive options
- torches having circular lighting when placed


### QOL
- refactor all code - ESPECIALLY SHADOW MAP CODE
- implement ambient occlusion

### RESONABLY DONE - maybe good? think about later

### HIGH PRIO
- better contour blend function - would make leaves and other contour dense areas look better
- white shadow map distortion artifacts
- somehow blends contour with far away chunk cutoff contour - the entire pencil thickness kernel gets effected, test with that
- somehow normalize thickness falloff to the baseline contour color
