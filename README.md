# OptifineRealTimePencilShader
Real Time Pencil Shader for the OptiFine Minecraft modification

## TODO

### LATER
- add tilable paper texture
- make/find paper normal map

### QOL
- make transparent blocks texture correctly
- make intuitive options
- refactor all code - ESPECIALLY SHADOW MAP CODE
- torches having circular lighting when placed

### RESONABLY DONE - maybe good? think about later

### HIGH PRIO
- fix white borders of blocks ignoring shadows - definitely some sort of shadow map displacement
- edge detection grains with stairs / paths? -caused by depth based CD
- fix shadowmap acne

- make lines thinner when far off in distance - or make them dimmer
