# OptifineRealTimePencilShader

## TODO

### LATER
- make/find paper normal map

### REALLY LOW PRIO
- make transparent blocks texture correctly
- make intuitive options
- torches having circular lighting when placed


### QOL
- refactor all code - ESPECIALLY SHADOW MAP CODE
- implement ambient occlusion

### RESONABLY DONE - maybe good? think about later

### HIGH PRIO
- white shadow map distortion artifacts
- fix aliasing on contours and artifacs from sky - check official zbuffer for the latter
