# OptifineRealTimePencilShader
Real Time Pencil Shader for the OptiFine Minecraft modification

## TODO

### LATER
- add tilable paper texture
- make/find paper normal map

### QOL
- make transparent blocks texture correctly
- make intuitive options
- refactor all code - ESPECIALLY SHADOW MAP CODE
- torches having circular lighting when placed
- implement ambient occlusion
- better contour blend function - would make leaves and other contour dense areas look better

### RESONABLY DONE - maybe good? think about later

### HIGH PRIO
- fix white borders of blocks ignoring shadows - definitely some sort of shadow map displacement
- fix shadowmap acne
